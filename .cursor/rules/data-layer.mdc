# Data Layer Guide

This project uses Prisma as the ORM with SQLite as the database.

## Database Setup
- [prisma/schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) - Database schema definition
- `prisma/db.sqlite` - SQLite database file

## Key Concepts
1. Prisma provides type-safe database access
2. The schema defines the database structure and relationships
3. Database migrations are managed through Prisma
4. The database client is accessible through server-side code

## Best Practices
1. Always use Prisma's generated types for database operations
2. Keep database operations in the server directory
3. Use transactions for operations that modify multiple records
4. Follow Prisma's naming conventions for models and fields
